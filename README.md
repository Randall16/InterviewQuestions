# Interview Questions

This repo just serves as an aggreagation of my solutions to common interview style questions. Most of these are solved using C++ and its Standard Template Library.

All files in this repo contain a main function and are ment to be ran in isolation of one another. Make sure to compile to C++11 or higher as many of the solutions use an "unordered_map" or "unordered_set" which didn't become standardized until C++11.
